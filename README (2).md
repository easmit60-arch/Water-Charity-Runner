# Water Runner Prototype Refections
- Reflect on your experience and prepare for job interviews and professional networking by answering all the questions below.
- Challenge / twist mechanics:
    - Flood loss condition if score goes above 135 (“village floods”).
    - Dam-building phase that changes gameplay (rain intensity decreases, river route shifts toward the village).
    - After building the dam, stored water drains over time, creating time pressure while you try to survive the “flourish” phase. 
- In this build I was not limited by time so I was able to keep the scope of the project that was in the concept, by focusing on building one complete gameplay loop (start, move, collect water, track score/storage, and reach an ending by losing). Once the basics worked, I added more than planned UI by introducing a twist: the dam-building phase, flood loss threshold, stored-water vs. draining, and a flourish timer. I enjoyed watching the game come to life and adding polish like village changes and a win celebration (confetti + overlay). Next time, I’d build in clear phases and playtest earlier to catch confusion and balance issues sooner.
- This project shows how I break a problem into smaller steps, test as I go, and keep iterating until the game feels clear and playable.
- Next time I’d playtest earlier so I can tune the difficulty faster, but I’m proud I was able to ship a working prototype with polished feedback.

  ## LinkedIn Post
  
Built a mini browser game prototype (*Water Runner*) with JavaScript + a little AI support, and I learned a lot about turning an idea into something actually playable. AI helped me move faster from “concept” to working code by brainstorming mechanics and helping debug logic, but JavaScript is what made it feel like a real game—tracking score + stored water, spawning random drops, and handling win/lose conditions.

Big takeaway: the fun isn’t just visuals—it’s balancing rules and giving the player clear feedback (HUD updates, status messages, and a win celebration). Next up I want to keep iterating on difficulty + polish.
If you’re curious, I’ll share a short clip/screenshot in the comments (or check out the project on GitHub).

## Project File Alignment

- Primary playable game (Prompt 8 mechanics): `index.html`
- Prompt guide text (all prompts): `README.md`
- Legacy starter files from the earlier grid game: `script.js` + `style.css` (kept for reference)

## Prompt 1: Theme + Mechanics Planning

### Goal
Create a Snake-like game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where:
- The snake is a river
- The player collects water droplets
- Water is stored in a water can

### Key Considerations
- Define the core loop: move, collect, store, survive
- Use a clear can capacity (for example, `12`) so there is a win target
- Add HUD info: score, stored water, capacity
- Choose boundary behavior: wrap-around or wall collision
- Add start/playing/win/lose game states
- Prevent water drops from spawning inside the river body

### Prompt 1 (Copy/Paste)
```text
I want to create a simple Snake-like game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want the snake to be a river, and people would collect water drops and store water in a water can.

Please suggest key considerations and gameplay mechanics for:
- Core loop
- Difficulty progression
- HUD design
- Win/lose states
- Fair spawning logic
```

#### 5) Win / Lose Conditions
Win:
- Village reaches **Thriving** state
- Final message:
  - “You delivered 10,000 virtual liters.”
  - “Real impact starts here.”
  - Button: “Support Real Water Access”

Lose (light, not punishing):
- Water tank reaches 0
- Player misses 10 droplets consecutively

### Narrative Summary
Water Runner draws inspiration from early mobile classics like Snake and Tetris — intentionally simple, pixel-styled, and accessible. The gameplay loop is intuitive: players collect falling water droplets, use them to build wells, rivers, and dams, and deliver clean water to a dry village. As water reaches the community, the landscape visibly transforms from barren to thriving — reinforcing the visual story at the heart of charity: water’s work.

### Prompt 2 (Copy/Paste)
```text
Build a single-player, retro pixel-art browser game called “Water Runner: Retro Impact” using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no external libraries).

Required flow:
1) Start screen with title, subtitle “Collect. Build. Deliver.”, Press Start button, and optional “Enable AI Assistant” toggle.
2) Gameplay scene with falling droplets at top, dry village at bottom, player near bottom center.
3) UI always visible: Water Tank Meter, Score, Well/River/Dam buttons, AI helper icon.
4) Core gameplay loop: Collect → Spend → Route → Deliver → Transform.
5) Feedback: score updates, visual cues, educational snippets, minimal retro sounds.
6) Win when village reaches “Thriving” and show:
   - “You delivered 10,000 virtual liters.”
   - “Real impact starts here.”
   - “Support Real Water Access” button.
7) Lose if water tank hits 0 or player misses 10 droplets in a row.

Technical constraints:
- Use finite states: start, playing, won, lost.
- Keep code modular with clear functions for spawn, collision, scoring, routing, UI, and win/lose checks.
- Keep the experience simple, accessible, and performant.

Output format:
- Provide full runnable code.
- Prefer one self-contained HTML file first; optionally show split version for style.css and script.js.
```

## Prompt 4: CSS Generation + Logic Review

Based on the design ideas above, this prompt is for generating new CSS for the Snake River game called **Water Runner**, while also requesting a quick logic critique.

### Context Summary
- Game concept: **Water Runner (Retro Catch + Build)**
- Combines visual impact from Idea 1 with conceptual depth from Idea 3 (AI tradeoff simulator)
- Includes AI-style NPC helper inspired by Clippy (Microsoft Office 97)
- Nostalgic style inspired by early mobile classics (Snake, Tetris): pixel graphics, limited palette, minimal controls
- Educational theme: clean water access + hidden water cost of technology

### Core Gameplay Loop
Collect Water → Build Infrastructure → Deliver to Communities → Repeat

### Phases
1. **Collect**
  - Move left/right to catch falling droplets
  - Each droplet increases stored water
2. **Build**
  - Spend water to build wells, rivers, and basic dams
  - Structures route water toward communities
3. **Deliver**
  - Community transforms: dry → green → thriving
  - Show a short real-world impact fact
  - Increase score

### AI Tradeoff Mechanic
AI helper can:
- Auto-catch droplets for 5 seconds
- Reveal optimal dam placement
- Slow droplet fall speed

Tradeoff:
- AI use costs stored water
- Trigger a visible “data center cooling” animation siphoning water
- Optional balancing idea: AI costs less after infrastructure improves

Educational messages:
- “Did you know? Training one large AI model can use ~700,000 liters of water.”
- “Data centers use millions of gallons of water each year to cool servers.”

### Prompt 4 (Copy/Paste)
```text
Based on my Water Runner game concept, generate a complete CSS redesign only (no HTML or JavaScript changes).

Game context:
- Retro Snake/Tetris-inspired web game for charity: water awareness
- Core loop: Collect Water → Build Infrastructure → Deliver to Communities → Repeat
- Includes AI helper tradeoff mechanic (convenience costs water)

CSS requirements:
1) Create a clean, playful, pixel-inspired visual style aligned with charity: water branding.
2) Use a reusable token system with CSS variables (:root) for colors, spacing, radius, shadows, and typography.
3) Include Google Font pairing for headings and body/UI text.
4) Style these areas:
  - Start screen
  - Game canvas/container
  - HUD (score, tank meter, status)
  - Build buttons (Well/River/Dam)
  - AI helper button/icon and warning/cost states
  - Educational popups
  - Win/Lose overlays
5) Add responsive breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
6) Ensure accessibility (contrast, focus states, readable text, reduced-motion support).
7) Keep visuals nostalgic but polished (simple borders, blocky/pixel feel, light playful accents).

Also include a short critique of my game logic:
- Confirm whether the loop/mechanics make sense.
- Identify weaknesses or risks.
- Suggest 5 practical improvements (especially around balance, clarity, and player onboarding).
```

### Logic Weaknesses + Improvement Opportunities
- **Complexity risk:** players may feel overloaded by collect/build/route/AI decisions at once.
- **Pacing risk:** AI cost and infrastructure cost can double-drain resources and stall progress.
- **Clarity risk:** tradeoff consequences may be unclear without strong UI previews.
- **Flow risk:** educational popups can interrupt active play if timed poorly.
- **Balance risk:** win/lose pacing may feel unfair without catch-up mechanics.

Suggested improvements:
1. Add a 60–90 second onboarding phase that unlocks mechanics gradually.
2. Show projected water cost before AI or build actions are confirmed.
3. Use non-blocking tooltip/toast facts instead of modal interruptions.
4. Add adaptive difficulty (drop-rate smoothing when player is struggling).
5. Add “recovery paths” (small passive refill or streak bonuses) to avoid deadlock states.

## Prompt 5: Confetti Milestones (Timed Score)

Use this prompt to add celebration effects based on time-limited score milestones.

### Milestone Rules
- Trigger confetti if water score reaches `10` in under `10` seconds
- Trigger confetti if water score reaches `30` (or greater) in under `30` seconds

### Prompt 5 (Copy/Paste)
```text
Update my Water Runner game to use a JavaScript confetti library and trigger confetti for timed score milestones.

Requirements:
1) Use a lightweight JS confetti library (prefer canvas-confetti).
2) Add milestone logic based on elapsed game time:
  - Trigger confetti when water score reaches 10 in under 10 seconds.
  - Trigger confetti when water score reaches 30 or more in under 30 seconds.
3) Ensure each milestone confetti effect fires only once per game run.
4) Reset milestone flags when a new game starts.
5) Keep existing gameplay logic intact (no unrelated feature changes).
6) Add clear helper functions, e.g.:
  - checkTimedMilestones(score, elapsedSeconds)
  - launchConfetti(level)
7) If the confetti library is unavailable, fail gracefully without breaking the game.

Output:
- Show the exact code changes needed in HTML/JS.
- Include where to place the library import and milestone checks in the game loop.
```

```text
Implement Prompt 5 directly in my existing index.html game.

Do these exact changes:
1) Add canvas-confetti via CDN script tag in index.html.
2) Track elapsed seconds from the moment gameplay starts.
3) Trigger confetti when:
   - water value reaches 10 in under 10 seconds
   - water value reaches 30 or more in under 30 seconds
4) Fire each confetti milestone only once per run.
5) Reset milestone flags and timer on restart/new game.
6) Keep all current game mechanics and UI behavior unchanged.
7) Fail gracefully if confetti library is unavailable.

Implementation details:
- Add helper functions:
  - launchConfetti(level)
  - checkTimedMilestones(waterValue, elapsedSeconds)
- Call `checkTimedMilestones` immediately after water value increases.
- Add a small on-screen message when confetti milestone is hit.

Return:
- A patch-style response showing exactly what changed in index.html.
```
